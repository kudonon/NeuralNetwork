This is a standard one hidden-layer Neural Network created for multiple uses.
It can be used with a variable number of inputs and variable number of neurons
in the hidden layer. 

For a personalized use, a couple of variables will have to changed to match
demand.

First, change the trainingData 2D vector in main() to match the desired
training data with how many ever variables you want.
Second, change the realValues to reflect the expected outcome of the 
training data
Third, create the desired Neurons in the hidden layer in addition to the 
output Neuron.
Fourth, decide the number of mathematical and computational iterations you
want the network to perform in addition to the desired interval for a console
feedback on the status.
Fifth, change/create additional Test Cases with input values to test/
evaluate the trained neural network

Lastly, run 'make' on shell and the Neural Network will be in session!

Enjoy!
